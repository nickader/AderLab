The Ader Lab at the Univeristy of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG) seeks to uncover how cells build and maintain compartments. More specifically, we're interested in the cell biology of membrane remodeling and compartmentalization, which we investigate using the model yeast, _S. pombe_. As a group, we value communication of our science with both peers in our field as well as to the general public. The Ader Lab aims to be a place where diverse scientists can learn and grow with each other, advancing not just the field but our personal growth as scientists. We acknowledge that the scientific endeavor has historically excluded certain groups and individuals, and we recognize our role to address and reduce structural barriers to individual success. In that light, we embrace the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion as they manifest in our spaces at UNCG and the broader community.
