Nick studies the cell biology of the nuclear envelope as a postdoctoral associate working with Dr. Patrick Lusk and Dr. Megan King. Nick is broadly interested in the various mechanisms cells employ to maintain compartmentalization. He did his doctoral work with Dr. Richard Youle and Dr. Wanda Kukulski on how mitochondrial membranes are reorganized during processes such as apoptosis and mitophagy using a variety of correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approaches. When he's not doing science, Nick enjoys, biking, D&D, and baking.
