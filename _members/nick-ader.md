Nick did his postdoc with Megan King and Patrick Lusk in the joint LusKing Lab at Yale School of Medicine. During his postdoc, he worked to uncover a new role for the ESCRT family of membrane remodelling proteins, demonstrating their ability to physically restrict the size of a membrane hole in the nuclear envelope. While at Yale, Nick also lent his expertise in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to drive a variety of other projects in the lab, including investigations of the ultrastructure of PARP inhibitor induced persistant interphase DNA bridges and nucleophagy. Nick developed his expertise in CLEM while working as a PhD student with Wanda Kukulski (then MRC Lab of Molecular Biology, now University of Bern) and Richard Youle (NINDS) where he developed and applied CLEM workflows that enabled elucidation of new contributions of mitochondrial membranes to Bax-mediated apoptosis. As an undergraduate, Nick's first foray into biological research came from formative undergraduate research experiences both at Villanova University (in the labs of Louise Russo and Aimee Eggler) as well as at the University of Luebeck (in the lab of Georg Sczakiel). Outside of the lab, Nick enjoys bird watching, baking, and table-top games of all sorts.
