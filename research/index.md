# How do cells build and maintain membranes?

Membranes are the bags that hold cells together. Within eukaryotic cells, sub-compartments are formed by organelle membranes to form specialized structures. Despite the essential nature of membranes to eukaryotic life, there are still many questions that remain unanswered:

1. How are a diverse array of organelle membranes constructed and maintained by the cell? 
2. What is the starting material for the biogenesis of a particular membrane? 
3. How is the biogenesis of membranes coordinated with the cell cycle? 

Our lab tackles these questions by studying model organism, _S. pombe_
