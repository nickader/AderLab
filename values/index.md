We believe that all takes to be a scientist is to start asking questions (though we ideally would like to try an answer those questions too!) We welcome intellectual contributions from all individuals in our group, recognizing that we will all collectively learn new things together and from one another.

It is **our mission** to:
1. Contribute new discoveries and ideas to the existing body of human knoweldge
2. Train a diverse community researchers for STEMM careers in an environtment that fosters supportive scientific investigation

We believe that the best science happens when individuals feel supported and trust one another. To that end, we value the communication between lab members that creates trust and the affirmative support that gives individuals the security to take risks and tackle big ideas. 

We also recognize that mentoring, like scientific experimentation, is an iterative and and imperfect endevaur. We thus strive to learn from our mistakes and contiually revisit our values and practices as a group.
